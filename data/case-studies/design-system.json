      "content": "This case study showcases the development of a comprehensive design system that unified user experiences across a complex suite of enterprise products—from hybrid AI platforms, to SaaS products and on-premises solutions. The project required extensive cross-functional collaboration and established accessibility as a foundational standard across the organization."

    "challenge": {
      "heading": "The Challenge",
      "intro": "Our enterprise product suite had grown organically over years, resulting in inconsistent user experiences, duplicated design work, and significant development overhead. Teams were working in silos, creating their own patterns and components without consideration for the broader ecosystem.",
      "highlightTitle": "Key Challenges",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Inconsistent UI patterns created fragmented experiences across enterprise products",
        "No centralized component library—teams rebuilt common patterns repeatedly",
        "Accessibility compliance gaps with no standardized WCAG strategy or implementation",
        "Development cycles slowed by redundant component recreation and design-dev handoff friction",
        "Jarring user experience when navigating between products due to visual and interaction inconsistencies",
        "Limited organizational awareness of design system value and ROI"
