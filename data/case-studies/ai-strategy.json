      "content": "Successful AI integration into legacy applications is tricky—it's about adding user value and building trust, not just cranking out features. This project demonstrates how to design intelligent experiences that build trust progressively through phased integration. Starting with low-risk writing assistance, evolving through conversational chat, and advancing to proactive recommendations and automation—each phase validates user confidence before introducing more autonomous capabilities. This approach makes complex AI feel intuitive and trustworthy while maintaining user control throughout."
